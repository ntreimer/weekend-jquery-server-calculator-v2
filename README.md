[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

_Duration: 3 Days_


The goal of this interface is to create a calculator which can take two number inputs and a mathematical operation and generate a result. These inputs form an object, where the server performs the logic of the computation. The client then retrieves the calculation. The DOM should also display the history of these inputs, and their result calculations.
